# 🌗 Next.js 15 + TailwindCSS Template with Dark Mode & RTL Toggle

This is a template project built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)** and **TailwindCSS**, featuring both a **Dark/Light theme toggle** and a **Right-to-Left (RTL) layout switcher**. It uses React Context and Tailwind utility classes to apply global styling based on user preferences, which are stored in `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌙 Dark/Light theme toggle using Tailwind's `class` strategy.
- 🌍 RTL/LTR layout toggle (simulate Arabic layout).
- 🧠 Global state management with React Context.
- 💾 User preferences stored in `localStorage`.
- ⚙️ Built using Next.js 15 with the App Router.

## 🎯 Why This Task Interested Me

I was particularly interested in this task because it explores enhancing user experience by implementing both dark/light theme toggling and RTL (Right-to-Left) support, which are essential for accessibility and internationalization. My focus was on building a clean and reusable solution using React context, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js 15’s App Router. I ensured that the selected theme and layout direction persist across sessions using localStorage, and that the app layout dynamically responds to user preferences without needing a full reload.
